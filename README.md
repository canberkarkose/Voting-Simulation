A web application that simulates voting and allows users to cast their vote. Also has admin features such as creating new polls and etc.

# Technologies Used 
* PHP for handling back end
* Javascript HTML and CSS for handling front end 
* JSON file for data storage

# Note 
1. If you want to use the admin features, when logging in your username and password should be admin for both. Otherwise you won't have access for the desired pages. If the admin user is not in the database yet ( haven't signed up ) you have to sign-up using these credentials and the email should be email@email.com
2. Without logging-in or signing-up, you can't access any page but signup and login.
